How much carbon I am responsible for?

A few days ago I decided to find out how much Green House Gases I was responsible for.

There are many nifty tools out there that can give you an estimate and a I finally settled with [Footprint Calculator](https://www.footprintcalculator.org/). Once of the cool features of the website is that it estimates not only your GHG gases but your general footprint. Not only that, but instead of showing you a number that is hard to contextualize (are 6000m2/yr of CO2 too much or too little?), it shows you how many planets Earth full of resources we would need to have if everyone was to have your same lifestyle. In a way, this is a very Sartre way of thinking (“Man is condemned to be free”- Existentialism is a Humanism (1946)), forcing us to think as role models for the rest of the species.

So, going back to my results: I was surprised. Since I’m vegan, I don’t have a car and I don’t buy many things, I was expecting that my livelihood could be within the reaches of our only lonely planet.

I was in shock when I discovered that it does not suffice with 1, but 2 planet Earth full of resources.

I wasn’t ready to accept that reality as it was, so I started adjusting several of the parameters in the calculator, trying to understand what was going on. After failing attempt after attempt, I tried reducing my flights hours. As someone that used to live in Europe but had his family in South America, I often took at least a transatlantic flight once a year for holidays. From anywhere but Spain, a round trip to Uruguay can take up to 35 hours of flying. And so when I removed my total flight hours and tried again, surprise surprise, I got my so long desired “1 planet Earth full of resources”.

The moral of the story is: flying produces A LOT! of GHG and even if you think that your footprint is small, you might be surprised.

I challenge you to give it a try, even if you don’t change anything in your life as a result: information is power.
