## **Context**

Last week I was self diagnosed with COVID-19 while in Barcelona.

Even though I have two shots of Sinovac, the vaccine does not fully prevent from getting sick and I was on the unlucky side of that equation.

Since then, I have experienced normal flu like symptoms and I seem to be recovering well. As part of the illness, I lost my sense of taste and smell, and I thought it would be interesting to share some of my experiences with this peculiar side effect of catching COVID.

## **Interesting Facts**

- Toothpaste still feels refreshing, although not minty.
- Raw onions somehow still feel strong, although I can't taste them.
- It is quite easy to have someone incorrectly take your sample for a PCR and testing negative as a consequence when you were always positive.
