I'm making a list of everything that I need to live. 

I like to think of myself as a minimalist and I have tried removing several things from my life before, in an attempt to "live with less".

This has not worked very well in the past, but it has taught me several interesting lessons worth sharing.

I realized that I had never attempted to be systematic in my listing of things I need, so my goal in the upcoming months is to start working on this list, and see where it goes.

Why? One the one hand, its fun. On a "more important" note, I feel that only once I write down everything that I need to life and thrive, I will be able to start making improvements and making smarter decisions about where I live, what I consume, etc.

Yes: I know that thinking about my personal consumption was created by big oil to shift the blame...I guess they succeeded?
