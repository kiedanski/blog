title: Ruthless photo deletions

I have almost 40000 photos in my photo library, enough that it is hard to even start thinking about organizing them.

I recently came back from a trip, and after trying to spend several hours deciding if a picture was good enough to make it or if I should delete it, I came up with a new rule:

- Keep at most 10 pictures per week for "normal weeks"
- Keep at most 30 pictures per week on holidays / traveling.

Already trying this has proven super useful: having a hard limit on what I can keep, made deciding what to delete much easier.

Hopefully, this will not only make photo processing easier, but will lead to smaller storage sizes overall.

Happy purging!
